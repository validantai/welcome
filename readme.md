# validant.ai — Systems for Trust & Agency

**validant.ai** is a deep-tech venture dedicated to building **trust infrastructure for the age of intelligent agents**.  
We develop technologies and frameworks that help people and organizations **verify, trust, and act** in an increasingly AI-mediated world.

Our core belief:  
> Trust is not a feature — it’s a system property.

## 🌍 What We Do

Validant.ai designs and develops systems that enable **Self-Sovereign Identity (SSI)**, **Proof-of-Personhood (PoP)**, and **AI-Agent Trust**.  
We work across three layers of the digital trust stack:

| Layer | Focus | Description |
|:------|:------|:------------|
| 🧠 **Human & AI Identity** | SSI, PoP, KYA | Verifiable identities for humans *and* intelligent agents (“Know-Your-Agent”). |
| 🪪 **Verifiable Credentials** | C2PA, W3C VC | Portable, cryptographically verifiable claims for authenticity and reputation. |
| 🔗 **Trust Infrastructure** | Data spaces, wallets, ledgers, and graphs | Building the rails for verifiable, explainable, and interoperable trust data. |

## ⚙️ How We Use GitHub

GitHub is our collaborative and transparent workspace for:
- **Open Research & Tooling** — public repositories for data pipelines, parsers, and visualization tools.  
- **Knowledge Infrastructure** — building structured, retrievable knowledge bases (e.g., *Knowledge Mirror Parser*).  
- **Responsible AI Engineering** — implementing auditable, explainable pipelines for data, embeddings, and identity layers.  
- **Community Collaboration** — documenting our contributions to open standards and open-source ecosystems.

We maintain both private R&D projects and selected **open repositories** that share:
- data transformation pipelines  
- research notebooks and prototypes  
- utilities for corpus building, semantic embeddings, and AI trust testing

## 🧩 Example Project — *Knowledge Mirror Parser*

Our `Knowledge Mirror Parser` transforms structured content (from Notion or GitHub Wikis) into clean, incremental corpora for retrieval and analysis.  
It powers our internal **Knowledge X (KX) Corpus**, a nightly-built, multimodal dataset ready for embedding into vector or graph databases.
